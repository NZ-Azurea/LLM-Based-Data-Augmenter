        "question": "The primary reason for a memory allocation error in R when indexing a large numeric vector is that R has a limited memory size, which is determined by the amount of available RAM. When you try to index a large vector, R attempts to allocate memory for the entire vector, which exceeds the available RAM, resulting in a memory allocation error.",
