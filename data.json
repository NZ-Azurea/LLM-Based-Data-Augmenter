        "question": "I have a dataframe with multiple columns and I want to filter out rows where a specific column has values present in less than 50% of rows. How can I do this in R?",
        "answer": "You can use the dplyr library in R to achieve this. First, you need to calculate the frequency of each value in the specified column and then filter out rows where the frequency is less than 50% of the total number of rows. Here's an example code snippet to help you achieve this:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# assume df is your dataframe and col is the column you want to filter\n\ndf %>%\n  group_by(col) %>%\n  summarise(freq = n()) %>%\n  filter(freq < 0.5 * nrow(df)) %>%\n  pull(col) %>%\n  unique() %>%\n  {paste0(\"!\", .)} %>%\n  eval() %>%\n  as.character() %>%\n  paste0(\"\", .) %>%\n  eval()\n\n```\nThis code will return a character string that you can use to filter out rows from your dataframe. For example, if the column 'col' has values 'A', 'B', and 'C' with frequencies 20, 30, and 50 respectively, the code will return `!\"A\"\"B\"` which you can use to filter out rows where 'A' or 'B' is present in the column.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the following code to achieve the same result:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# assume df is your dataframe and col is the column you want to filter\n\ndf %>%\n  filter(!col %in% names(table(df[col]))[table(df[col]) < 0.5 * nrow(df)])\n\n```\nThis code will directly filter out rows where the value in the specified column is present in less than 50% of rows.\n\nNote: Make sure to replace 'df' and 'col' with your actual dataframe and column names."

        "question": "I have a vector of numbers and I want to calculate the average of every group of nearby elements that differ by less than 10. For example, if I have the vector c(28, 30, 50, 55, 99, 102), I would like to obtain a new vector where elements differing less than 10 from one to another are averaged. How can I do this using vectorized operations in R?",
        "answer": "You can use the cumsum function to create a vector of indices where the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 10, and then use tapply to calculate the mean of each group. Here's an example code snippet:\n\n```r\nvec <- c(28, 30, 50, 55, 99, 102)\nindx <- cumsum(c(0, diff(vec)) > 10)\ntapply(vec, indx, mean)\n#    0     1     2 \n# 29.0  52.5 100.5 \n```\n\nThis will give you the desired output: c(29, 52.5, 100.5).\n\nTags: R, vectorized operations, cumsum, tapply, mean"
